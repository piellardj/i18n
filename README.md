# i18n
This project is a silly tool to translate to and from numeronyms such as "i18n" (which stands for "internationalization"). The reverse translation illustrates how confusing such abbreviations can be.

Only keep the first and last letters, and add the count of inner letters. Makes communication easier. M3s c11n e4r.
